description: "I often end up speaking about infosec with friends that don't know much about this topic, and it can be a lot to handle at once, many complicated words, techniques, etc. So here's a glossary of the main attacks, but with weird descriptions!"

# Not translated, because I'm lazy af! :]

- Original (french) here : [Infosec made easy]({{< ref path="hacking/infosec_made_easy" lang="fr">}})
- Translator here : [Deepl translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator)

>  No, more seriously, having to translate (localize) and format all the articles in two languages takes a huge amount of time that completely demotivates me to write new articles, that's why some of them are no longer translated. There will be French or English editions depending on the targeted audience, and if you ever feel like a translator... Hit me up?
